displacementgraph.py

This program will allow data taken from the DEBEN OFR and output a graph 
the Programme reads the file called 'DATA.csv' in the SAME DIRECTORY as where the code is run from (this so it can be excutable)  
The programme requires the user input the change in degree per data sample taken (e.g 10 or 20 degrees) 
then it will require the total degrees travelled e.g 180 (degrees) 
the programme then outputs a graph and saves the graph to the directory of the code
