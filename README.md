displacementgraph.py

This program will allow data taken from the DEBEN OFR and output a graph. The data has been aqquired using sylconnect software with a horizontal indicator (channel ID 1) and vertical indicator (channel ID 2) 

The Programme reads the file called 'DATA.csv' in the SAME DIRECTORY as where the code is run from (this so it can be excutable)  

the programme requires the user input when requested in the programme to change the degree per data sample taken e.g 10 or 20 (degrees) 

the programme requires the user input when requested in the programme to change the total degrees travelled e.g 180 (degrees) 

The programme then outputs a graph and saves the graph to the directory of the code
